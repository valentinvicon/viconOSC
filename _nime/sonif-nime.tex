% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

- Vicon extensions (SDK plugin)

\subsubsection{Max modules}
\textbf{- Objects generation \& performance mechanics}\\ \par
Manipulating objects algorithm consists of 3 steps: object generation, finding the object and releasing the object on the floor. Object generation is performed by random generators, functioning within certain limits. These limitations are influenced by the dimensions of the room in which the Vicon system is installed. Finding the object supposes continuous mathematic relations between the coordinates of the object and coordinates of the selected marker. When these coordinates are close enough one to another, the object is retreived and manipulated by performer (eg. define gesture); After all these actions are completed, a simple comparison between the coordinates of the floor and the value of the z axes of the marker is done in order to put down the object.\\ \par
\textbf{- Gesture recognition}\\ \par
Interaction between sound control and human gesture has constantly increased over the last years \cite{Gestureanalysis}. Probabilistic models for analysing motion and sound relationships became a necessity and a forthcoming tool \cite{probabilisticmodels}. \textit{Mubu} containers provided by Ircam laboratories in MAX/MSP software represents a handy tool to record and analyze gesture, captured with Vicon system \cite{mubu}. Gesture recognition is based on Hierarhical Hidden Markov Model implemented in mubu.hhmm object of MAX/MSP.
